# üåç Sustainability & Carbon Impact Analysis

This project presents an independent analysis of sustainability and carbon emission data using Power BI. The goal is to assess environmental impact, identify high-emission areas, and explore actionable strategies to reduce carbon footprints.

## üìä Power BI Dashboard

The `Sustainability_Dashboard.pbix` file contains an interactive dashboard that includes:

- Emission trends across sectors and time
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) for carbon impact
- Scenario-based simulations for policy and behavioral changes
- Sector-wise contribution to carbon output
- Visual insights into sustainability metrics

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You can view the dashboard by opening the `.pbix` file in [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).

### üîç Preview

Here‚Äôs a snapshot of the dashboard:
